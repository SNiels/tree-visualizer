# Tree Visualizer

A jQuery plugin that allows you to transform a given XML structure into a HTML/CSS tree. No SVG required.

At this moment the plugin focuses on output of the Alpino parser. More specifically, it is designed to fullfil the needs of the GrETEL project.

More information and an updated version will follow soon.

**At the moment it is not recommended to clone this repo as it is in a very old stage and needs a lot of work. The CSS is usable, but I'd refrain from touching the JS if you have no experience.**
